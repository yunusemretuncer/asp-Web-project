# ASP.NET Core CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This repository demonstrates a **real-world Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline** for an ASP.NET Core application using **GitHub Actions**.

The goal of this project is not just deployment, but **engineering-quality CI/CD**:
- fast feedback
- quality gates
- reproducible builds
- traceable artifacts

## 🚀 What This Pipeline Does

### Continuous Integration (CI)
The CI pipeline runs automatically on every **pull request** and **push to main**.

It enforces:

- ✅ Code formatting consistency (`dotnet format --verify-no-changes`)
- ✅ Dependency restore with caching (NuGet cache)
- ✅ Clean builds with warnings treated as errors
- ✅ Unit test execution
- ✅ Reproducible build output (artifacts)

CI is split into **multiple stages** for fast feedback:
1. **Format check** (fail fast)
2. **Restore**
3. **Build & Test**
4. **Package artifact**

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
The CD pipeline:

- Runs **only after CI succeeds**
- Downloads the exact artifact produced by CI
- Is environment-aware (`dev`)
- Produces traceable release metadata

This follows the **build once, deploy many** principle.

## 📦 Build Artifact: `app-publish.zip`

The CI pipeline produces an artifact named:
